# Search
To enable the Search in the Template you need to install the System-Extension "Indexed Search". Then include the Plugin for the search on a page. Enter the Uid in the Constant of the template and it should work.

<b>If you are in the debug-mode, there is no cached-page and with it no index, so the search won't work.</b>
